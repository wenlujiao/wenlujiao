### About Me
I’m an undergraduate student with a background in Economics and a growing interest in quantitative analysis, data science, and optimization.  
Recently, I’ve been learning Python, statistics, and machine learning to build a stronger foundation for graduate study in applied AI.

I’m especially interested in:
- How data and algorithms improve decision-making in business or policy  
- Quantitative modeling and optimization methods  
- Applications of AI in economics and management
